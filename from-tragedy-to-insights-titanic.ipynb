    "In that decision, I found newfound inspiration. I laid out the steps, prepared my Python notebook, and began delving into the Titanic dataset. Despite the debated boredom, I discovered intriguing findings that sharpened my data science skills.<br>\n",
    "So, let's leave behind the common mindset and dare to face the challenge. This is my first step towards building an extraordinary data science portfolio.\n",

    "## About Titanic Disaster\n",
    "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.<br>\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n",
